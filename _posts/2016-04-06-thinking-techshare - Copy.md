title: Thinking techshare 2
---

I still haven't decided on my techshare, which is supposed to in June 13 or 20th.

I read about this, Devcards thing. It uses cards to denote code blocks. Fun and simple. It seems to be a fancy way to implement the lego idea for building and managing apps. 

I also read this loomio thing. It is a collective decision making tools. Seems to be handy for voting good projects...or not so good projects.....
