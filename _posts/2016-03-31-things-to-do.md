title: Things to do
---



Sometimes, I am overwhelmed by the number of things that I could do. Sometimes, I felt that I have nothing to do. Most of the time, I don't know which thing truly matters. 

I know I want to make a difference. But I feel that whatever I do will be immersed in the sea of human faces. A small voice telling me: there is nothing that I am going to do which hasn't been done by another human being. Another voice says that: you ought to have something different. You got your PHD, you worked as a professor, you worked in IBM lab. Now, you work in ESRI, the number one GIS company. You have always been with smart people and with great opportunity...But still what do I actually have, which can make a difference. 

Here are some small projects on my mind: 

(1) finish my value evaluator for point aggregate as a toolkit...
(2) create a event replay app, which shows spatial connections between events...
(3) create an app showing spatial heteogeneity of housing prices...

although I have so much doubt about myself. I have to move on...maybe one day I will know....so moving on, 2016...a year of silent move...
